        "text": "Table of Contents\nPart I\nItem 1. Business\nOur Company\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructure\ncompany with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA programming model that runs on all NVIDIA GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific software libraries,\nsoftware development kits, or SDKs, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and\neases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated computing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training and\ninference, data analytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to\nautomotive and manufacturing.\nOur data-center-scale offerings are comprised of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands of GPU-accelerated servers\ninterconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern\nAI applications.\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence,\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep\nlearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots, and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and\nproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content\nsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as products,\nservices, media, or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user's preferences.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we\nserve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and\nnetworking and software stacks.

We have invested over $58.2 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern\ncomputing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA\nprogramming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way for\nthe emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition,\nmarking the \u201cBig Bang\u201d moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous\ndriving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking, enabled our platforms to\nbe data center scale, and led to the introduction of a new processor class \u2013 the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software\nstacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the world\u2019s largest industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for\nhealthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization; and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software \u2013 essentially an operating system for enterprise AI\napplications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high performance computing, or HPC. With a strong\nengineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking,\nsoftware and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.\nThe world\u2019s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable,\naccelerate, develop, or enrich the services and offerings they deliver to billions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, AI foundation models, search,\nrecommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, and translation.\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new generative and agentic AI-enabled products\nand services, and/or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI\nassistants, chatbots, and agents; the transportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug discovery;\nand the financial services industry for customer support and fraud detection.\n4\n",

GeForce Experience\nenhances each gamer\u2019s experience by optimizing their PC\u2019s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance\nand accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers\nartists, designers, and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games,\nmovie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise\nand GeForce NOW for gaming.\nAdvancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of autonomous vehicles, or AV, and electric vehicles, or EV, is revolutionizing\nthe transportation industry. The algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-\ncoded approaches and will use multiple neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide an AI-based hardware and software solution, designed and implemented\nfrom the ground up based on automotive safety standards, for the AV and EV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our\npartnerships with automotive OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks\nbefore their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-\nbottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through license and\ndevelopment agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products or have us do so through a custom development. Such\nlicense and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\nSales and Marketing\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient computing platforms\nand software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with customers and various industry ecosystems through our\npartner network. Our partner network incorporates global, regional and specialized CSPs, OEMs, ODMs, ISVs, global system integrators, add-in board\nmanufacturers, or AIBs, distributors, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, and other ecosystem participants.\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and solution\narchitects to provide pre-sales assistance to our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. For\nexample, our solution architects work with CSPs to provide pre-sales assistance to enable our customers to optimize their hardware and software infrastructure\nfor generative AI and LLM training and deployment. They also work with foundation model and enterprise software developers to enable our customers to\noptimize the training and fine-tuning of their models and services, and with enterprise end-users, often in collaboration with their global system integrator of\nchoice, to fine-tune models and build AI applications. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network\u2019s\ntime-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our customers and partner network to use the next\ngeneration of our products within each platform.\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software\ndevelopment community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to\nascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program supports the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for\nsoftware applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in\nindustries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive. Our desktop gaming products\ntypically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International\nOrganization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of\nthe significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the\nproduction of our products, such as memory, substrates, and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used\nin the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. In periods\n8\n",

Our supply chain is mainly concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from\nSK Hynix Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors\nand contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our\nfinal products.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the\nprincipal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software\nsupport, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain\ncompetitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to\ndeliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing\ncompetitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by\nour products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI\ncomputing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel,\nand proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be\nmore able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\nOur current competitors include:\n\u2022\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including\nsolutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n\u2022\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or AI computing functionality as part\nof their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation,\nor Microsoft;\n\u2022\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as\nAmazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\n\u2022\nsuppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming\ndevices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung,\nor companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n\u2022\nnetworking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as AMD,\nArista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and Marvell\nTechnology, Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to\nprotect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous\npatents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our\nproducts and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The\nlaws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more\nlikely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\u2022\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\n9\n",

The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL\n72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and\nCountry Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand\nthat partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,\n(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\nand/or performance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing\nrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and\nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated \u201cTier 2\u201d by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose\nrestrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our\nability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

Fiscal year 2025 metrics are expected to be published in the first\nhalf of fiscal year 2026. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global\nenvironmental sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. We committed to purchase or generate enough renewable\nenergy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under our operational control starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year\n2024, we made progress towards this goal and increased the percentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year\n2026, we also aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA\u2019s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with the goal of effecting supplier\nadoption of science-based targets.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is\nimportant in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for\nmany workloads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. We continue to have a strong presence on the\nGreen500 list of the most energy-efficient systems\u2014we powered 8 of the top 10 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the\nNovember 2024 Green500 list.\nWe launched our Earth-2 initiative to create a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies,\nand policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year\n2025, we had approximately 36,000 employees in 38 countries; 27,100 were engaged in research and development and 8,900 were engaged in sales,\nmarketing, operations, and administrative positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\nrelating to human capital management.\nTo execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including exceptional executives, scientists,\nengineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be high, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent to\nNVIDIA.

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely\naffected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will\ndemand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We\ncannot ensure that our products and technologies will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial\nresults may be harmed.\nWe offer enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI\nmodels. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud\nservice agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services have changed\nand may continue to shift, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services may not be successful and will take time,\nresources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and\nother software products.

These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us\nfrom doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge\non our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of\nour customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those\nwe are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish\nmarket share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand\nfor our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately,\nhas led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting\nthe semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,\nprovided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue.\nWe may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply\ncommitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both\nproduct shortages and excess inventory, significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and\ncontract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely\nmanner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our\nproducts are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a\nbroader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are\nnot available from third parties.\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory\nor reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for\ncertain of our products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical\nlead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to\nincrease as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of\nthese factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\ninclude:\n\u2022\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\n\u2022\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n\u2022\nchanges in business and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n\u2022\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\u2022\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\n\u2022\nincrease in demand for competitive products;\n\u2022\nchanges in end-user demand;\n16\n",

Extended lead times may occur if\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\nnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\nAI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Qualification\ntime for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product\nintroductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation\narchitectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future\narchitecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as\nplanned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that\ncould increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter\nof fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products\nor adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be\nable to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product\ntransitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\nsupply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able\nto generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any\nreasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our products, including by leading to\ninconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum.\nIt is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of\n17\n",

Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in\ncryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain\ntransactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate\ndemand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and\nmay in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs,\nwhich could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may\nbe resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete\nwith our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our\nrevenue.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product\nquantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques.

They have in the past and may in the future contain defects, security vulnerabilities,\nexperience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may\nalso increase when our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and when we rely on\npartners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software\nproducts that we or our partners offer rely on training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain\nunknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product\ndefect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in\nour products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties\nwho develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications\ncould lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIB manufacturers, automotive manufacturers,\nand tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair or\nreplacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management\npersonnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our\ncustomers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to\nachieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and\nprospective customers and partners and consumers\u2019 perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin,\nrevenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the\nfield or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other\ndefects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods.\nWe recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty\nobligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of\nour products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of\ndefending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business\nliability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy,\ndisruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses,\nincluding on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints, and\nglobal economic and geopolitical developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the USG or other governments, have in the past and/or could in the\nfuture have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\n\u2022\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and\nmay do so in the future;\n\u2022\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce\nour margins;\n\u2022\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers\u2019 or our licensees\u2019 inability to supply products to customers\nand/or end users;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n19\n",

These datasets may be flawed,\ninsufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise decrease resilience to security incidents that may compromise the integrity of our AI\noutputs, leading to potential reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, or adverse impacts on the performance and reliability of our products, which could, in turn,\naffect our partners' operations, customer trust, and our revenue. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers,\nincluding for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information\nsecurity measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past and may happen in the\nfuture), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security\nincident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are\ncompromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to\nresult in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed\nto ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable\nindustry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate\ncertain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls,\nsystems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a\nsecurity incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures,\nalong with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties,\ncould expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory\ninquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code\nfrom third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to the risk of\nloss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on\nexperience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse\nconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation,\nindemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our\nsystems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders,\ndelayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. We are\nrequired by certain data privacy and security obligations to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of\nsecurity incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may\ngather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause disruptions to our worldwide operations include: natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, power\nor water shortages, critical infrastructure failures, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest,\nacts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory changes, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California,\nand other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural\ndisasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on\nthird-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse\npolitical developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWorldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product\ncomponents and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our\noperations and operating strategies, product\n21\n",

For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with\nthe State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic\nboycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including\nnatural disasters, high heat events, water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, and\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and\nconsolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or\nour customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully\nresume operations. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. All of these risks and conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,700\nemployees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our\nemployees in the region have been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product\ndevelopment or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended or expanded, it\ncould impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events\ndescribed above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As\nwe increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages\nand other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages,\nland or permitting constraints, or regulations that limit energy, water, or land availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center\ncapacity and consume our products and services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and\nreliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme\nheat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for\nour Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact\non our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we\nmaintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and\ncost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not\ncovered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations\nrelating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in\ngreater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes,\nincreased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, and\ngreater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions\ncould harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We\nmay not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals.\nWe may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased\nlitigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concerns\naround the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing\nplatforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate\nacquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\n22\n",

If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions\nthat could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining\nregulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may\nevolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively\nimpact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived\nability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly traded\ncompanies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to\ninvest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage\ncompanies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment,\nand we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment\nand/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry\nsectors could increase our impairment losses.\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management\u2019s\nattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in\nobtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition\nor investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are\nacquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key\npersonnel, of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n\u2022\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\u2022\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\u2022\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an\nacquisition;\n\u2022\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or\nother restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n\u2022\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n\u2022\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target\u2019s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and\ncostly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes\nwith our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of\noperations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to\ncustomers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of\nthese customers.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.

Our operating results depend on sales to our\npartner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our technologies. We have a small number of partners that are involved\nin system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of\nour key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our\nability to sell our advanced data center systems to customers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our\ncustomers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may\ndevelop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the\nmarkets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. Many of our indirect customers often do not\npurchase directly from us but through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect\ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or\nmore of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near\na quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and\namount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or\nother countries\u2019 trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive and successfully execute our business strategy, we must attract, retain, and motivate our executives and key employees, as well as\nrecruit and develop exceptional and diverse talent. However, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry\u2019s highly\ncompetitive market for skilled workers and leaders, and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations, or in their\nadministration or interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for talent drives up costs in the form of cash and\nstock-based compensation. In times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our\nstock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective\nsuccession planning, transfer of knowledge, and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning, execution, and\nlong-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such\nsystems may disrupt our business and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial\nreporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our\ngrowth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system\nimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully\noperate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose\nsubstantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial\nstatements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any\nmaterial weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results\non a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be\nsubject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities\nanalysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our past\nresults of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n24\n",

For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended\npayment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have\nrequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have\navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating\nvolatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is\nlikely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or substantial price volatility.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may\nadversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;\ntaxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls\nand cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product\nregulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.\nCompliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations\nand ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate\napplicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws,\nrules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs,\nand/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European\nUnion, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding\nour business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have\nalso received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United\nKingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our\ninvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our\nstrategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and\npartners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impact\nour business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop\nfrontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year\ntransitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already\nenacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.\nRestrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of\nnew systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to\nlaws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties\nor tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the\ntiming of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively\nimpact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on\n25\n",

If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the\nviolation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse\nimpact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which\nblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to\nRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of\nenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,\nmodels, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,\ntuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users\nworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.\nAs geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control\nrestrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China and over 150 countries\ndesignated \u201cTier 2\u201d by the January 2025 AI Diffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or\ncould impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial\nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened,\nwould further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a\ncompetitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated\nwith AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our\nproducts, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI\ncloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China\nand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our\nproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting\nour business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve\noverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our\nproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our\nsales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example, regulators\nin China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If regulators\nconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions\non our ability to conduct our business, restrictions regarding our networking products and services, or otherwise impact our operations in China, any of which\ncould have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n26\n",

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\nproducts (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to\nthese requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,\n(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\nand/or performance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to \u201cTier 2\u201d status. The AI Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on\nselect \u201cUniversal Verified End Users\u201d, or UVEU, and lesser benefits on \u201cNational Verified End Users\u201d, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerous\neffects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports,\nand transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier 1 countries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firms\nthat achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers\u2019 costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply and\ndistribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export\ncontrols, or other regulatory actions.\nThe AI Diffusion IFR\u2019s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using\ncovered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or\nmore of the identified countries.\n27\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nFollowing these 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China\nand Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution\noperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for\nwhich the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing\nrequirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\nlicense or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions that\nwe or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG evaluates license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or\nan opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or \u201cNAC,\u201d process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers\nin China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-\nsized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and\nmay in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire\nlicenses for their products.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if\ncustomers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other\nextended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition\ncosts. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users\ncannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale\ntechnical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor\nsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time\nand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries\ndesignated \u201cTier 2\u201d by the AI Diffusion IFR. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a\nservice large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose\nadditional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized\nsystem configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands\nsuch controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may\nhave a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a\nsubstantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may\nalso negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking\nproducts, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control\nthat impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors\nthat sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside\nChina and other impacted regions to \u201cdesign-out\u201d certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that\nthey are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas\ngovernments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and\nfinancial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in\nother markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced\nsemiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the\nsame time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are\nsubject to worldwide licensing requirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase obligation charges.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in\nwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\n28\n",

The Chinese government may also encourage\ncustomers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing\ncomponents made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing\ncertain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new\nstandards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the\nChinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,\nthis may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results\nand financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new\nrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks\nand adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and government regulators have focused on\ncorporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our\ncorporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other regulatory\nrequirements or our various stakeholders\u2019 expectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may\nnot meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting\nstandards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate\nsustainability practices and legal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not expand business\nwith existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business\nactivities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm\nand liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and\nservices, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its\nadoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions\nthat have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or\nother social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and\nuse of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Leveraging\nAI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations\nfrom different jurisdictions related to AI may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may\nimpede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and\nproposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development,\nand create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for\nGeneral Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related to\nour risk framework. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business\npractices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of AI by\nus or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful\nor if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties\nthat we have agreed to indemnify.

We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If\ninfringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party\u2019s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the\nthird party\u2019s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities\nor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross\nlicense our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore,\nthe indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in\nwhich we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm\nour competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and\nmarketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek\nformal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if\napproved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage our\nreputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and\ninternal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate\nuse of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters,\nincluding for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in\nour possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased\nsecurity or remediation costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\ndata privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses,\nincluding providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights\nmay include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising,\nprofiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states\nalso impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments.\nThese state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy\nRights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal\ninformation, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and the law\ncreated a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels.\nAdditionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to\nadditional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or\n4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us\nand require us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe\u2019s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, regulates resilience and incident\nresponse capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital infrastructure sector. Non-compliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative\nfines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up to 2% of the total worldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data\n30\n",

The European Commission released a set of\n\u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found\nto provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance\nand participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these\nmechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the\nUnited States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any\nof which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China\u2019s law imposes various\nrequirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China\u2019s law, including personal data, may not be\ntransferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements,\nincluding CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or\nimpact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our\nbusiness operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to\nincrease our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies\nfrom transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR\u2019s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness.\nWe are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful\nor may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific\ncontractual restrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that\npersonal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials\nand other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the U.S. are\nincreasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or\nmisrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is\ninconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant\nconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial\ncondition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected\ntax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other\nadverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with\na significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced,\nour provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax\nrate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of international tax developments, including the implementation of the Two-Pillar\nframework led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain\nmultinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as Pillar One), and imposes a minimum\neffective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which we conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting,\nelements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, or changes in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect our\nprovision for income taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries\nwith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions,\n31\n",

Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax\nrate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our\neffective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder,\nconsumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business.

Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other\nremedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome,\nlitigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our\nBoard of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder\napproval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and super-\nmajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if\nsomeone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.\nThese provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors\nof their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\nItem 1B.

Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard for\nInformation Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk\nmanagement and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place\ncybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy and cybersecurity laws and (b) prevent,\ndetect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data they process on our behalf, the\ndistribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that\nhave access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and\nsecurity controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and data they\nprocess on our behalf.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d our\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\u00a0\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the\ngaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin\napplications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for our\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2025.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and\nscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\nnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\nAI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\nfrequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\nour ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\nfrequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\nWhile we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\nGlobal Trade\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n36\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL\n72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and\nCountry Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand\nthat partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before\neach shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in\nfiscal year 2025. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in October 2023. The\nmarket in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. To the extent that a\ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such\na license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,\n(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\nand/or performance density.\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing\nrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and\nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated \u201cTier 2\u201d by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose\nrestrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our\nability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\u2013 Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\u201d for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including\u202finflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and global economic and\ngeopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and\nquantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our\ninvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\n37\n",

Our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. Some of our employees in the region have been on active military duty for\nan extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations.

These platforms incorporate processors,\ninterconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data\nCenter, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago.\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 142% from a year ago. The strong year-on-year growth was driven by demand for our Hopper architecture\naccelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. We began shipping production\nsystems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 21% from a year ago, driven by the continued ramp of Ada RTX GPU workstations for use cases\nsuch as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and benefits expenses due to employee growth and\ncompensation increases, and engineering development, compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of\nrevenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation\nuncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories,\nincome taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and\nfor excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\nand future product purchase\n38\n",

Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party\nmanufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for\nsome products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and\nprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and\njudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we\noperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\naccordingly.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence.\nTo the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the\nperiod.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\ndistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs\nbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for\nspecific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.\nEstimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\n39\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\ncontract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\nsignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\nselling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in\ncomparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service\nseparately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 is presented below.

Revenue from Data Center networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet\nplatform.\nGraphics revenue \u2013 The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\nReportable segment operating income \u2013 The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income was driven by growth in revenue. The\nyear over year decrease in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an increase of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in\nrevenue.\nAll Other operating loss \u2013 The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and\ncompensation increases.\nConcentration of Revenue\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We\nhave certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete\ntheir build.

Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer\nwhich primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more\nof total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\nassembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test\nyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs.\u00a0Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related\nintangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to\npersonnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of Data\nCenter revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of\npreviously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal\nyears 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was\nan expense of 13.3% and 12.0% for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a prior year discrete benefit due to an audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction,\nstock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit, and income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal\nstatutory tax rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the audit resolution.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the\nnear term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.

As of January\u00a026, 2025, we had\n$43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the\nnext twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity\nand capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations\nand financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable\nsecurities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\u00a0IV, Item\u00a015 of this Annual\nReport on Form\u00a010-K for additional information.\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related\nforeign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at\nthe end of fiscal year 2025 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we\nrepurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for $34.0 billion. As of January\u00a0 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to\nrepurchase up to\u00a0$38.7 billion of our common stock.\nFrom January\u00a027, 2025 through February\u00a021, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share\nrepurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may\npursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834\u00a0million. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors'\ncontinuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made\nafter December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January\u00a026, 2025, by year payable, are as follows:\n\u00a0\nJan 26, 2025\n\u00a0\n(In millions)\nDue in one year\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\nDue in one to five years\n2,250\u00a0\nDue in five to ten years\n2,750\u00a0\nDue in greater than ten years\n3,500\u00a0\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\n(37)\nNet long-term carrying amount\n$\n8,463\u00a0\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

We expect to increase capital\nexpenditures in fiscal year 2026 relative to fiscal year 2025 to support the future growth of our business.\nUnrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $251\u00a0million, were recorded in non-current income tax payable at the\nend of fiscal year 2025. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties\nin the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing\nrenewable energy or climate-related business trends.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1\u00a0of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\u00a0IV, Item\u00a015 of this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for\u00a0a discussion of adoption of new\nand recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our\noverall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of our businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of\nplus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments of $238 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to\nNote 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\u00a0IV, Item\u00a015 of this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as substantially all of our sales are in United States dollars and foreign\ncurrency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rates.\u00a0Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included\nin other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2025\nand 2024.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate\nfluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively\nimpact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their\nmanufacturing costs.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January\u00a026, 2025 and January\u00a028, 2024, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelated to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $136 million and $116 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when\nrecognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income\nbefore taxes of $129 million and $60 million as of January\u00a026, 2025 and January\u00a028, 2024, respectively.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\u00a026, 2025 based on the criteria set forth in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nJanuary\u00a026, 2025.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\u00a026, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January\u00a026, 2025 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update\nmuch of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The\nupgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal\ncontrols, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits\nof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n46\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of January 26, 2025 and\nJanuary 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended January 26, 2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively\nreferred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\n26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n50\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of\nproducts, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\nconditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory\npurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and\nevaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past\nresults, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary\u00a026, 2025\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.\n51\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nAll references to \u201cNVIDIA,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nIn June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity\nbalances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were all 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\nthose related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,\ninvestigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other\ncharges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We\ndetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\nobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is\ngenerally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\nand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for\nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and MDFs which\nrepresent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners\u2019 activities while also\npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based\non the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n57\n",

        "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\nare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each\nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\nfrequently sold along with support, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.\nRevenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably\nover the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\ncontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\ncertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\nindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\nselling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar\ncircumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware\ncomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\nor RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\ngrant to estimate the fair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensation\nexpense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation\nexpense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of\nshares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and\nSeptember of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and\nmarket-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\nother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-\nparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that\ncauses us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\n58\n",

However, the actual\nliability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that\na loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax\njurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\nevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\nchanges in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\ndue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January\u00a026, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\u00a0billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent\nrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is\ncomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\nanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\ncash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held\nequity securities. We classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are\nreported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019\nequity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are\ndetermined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost\nbasis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than\nnot we will be required or we intend to\n59\n",

Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the Other income (expense), net\nsection of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPublicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (expense), net.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short\nmaturities as of January\u00a0 26, 2025 and January\u00a0 28, 2024. Marketable debt and equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative\ndepends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods\nof change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as\naccounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges,\nchanges in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts\nreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and\nincludes certain limits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition and maintain an allowance for\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall\nestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist\nprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We\ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for\nexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a\nnew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\nbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases\nare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease\nassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing\nrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\n60\n",

The income and market\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\nfactors and the future profitability of our business.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\nthe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no\nlonger be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\nas goodwill. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently\nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of\nprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. These investments are\nmeasured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or\nsimilar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation\nrequires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are\nrecognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative\nbased on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value\nand record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n61\n",

We adopted this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual report. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We do not expect the\nadoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,\nincluding, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within\neach income statement expense caption, as applicable. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of\nthis standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have\nacquired Arm from SoftBank.

Our RSUs, PSUs, and market-\nbased PSUs are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the\ndividend yield.\nAdditionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\nEquity Incentive Program\nWe grant RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions\nof various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance\nstock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive\nstock options. We grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan.

Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts\ngreater than one year in length will be recognized over the next twelve months.\nNote 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign\ncurrency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. In fiscal years 2025 and\n2024, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such\ninstruments were determined to be highly effective.\nWe also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign\ncurrency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the\nchange in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:\nJan 26, 2025\nJan 28, 2024\n\u00a0\n(In millions)\nDesignated as accounting hedges\n$\n1,424\u00a0\n$\n1,168\u00a0\nNot designated as accounting hedges\n$\n1,297\u00a0\n$\n597\u00a0\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of January\u00a026, 2025 and January\u00a028, 2024.\nAs of\u00a0 January\u00a0 26, 2025,\u00a0 all foreign currency contracts mature within\u00a0 18 months.

The amended\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,\nand SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand\nbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including\nattorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel\naffirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel\u2019s majority decision to\nreverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to stay\nthe mandate pending NVIDIA\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court\u2019s final disposition of the matter.\nNVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024.

On February 20, 2025,\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further\nproceedings.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed\nJanuary 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once\nthe appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,\npurportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and\nviolations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel\ninventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and\nimprovements to NVIDIA\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et\nal. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the In Re\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company\u2019s petition for writ of\ncertiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties\ndiscuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain\nofficers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and\nviolations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel\ninventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits\nfrom the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.\n2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and\ninsider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on\nGPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of\nunspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation\naction.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of January\u00a026, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities,\nwhile reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are\nengaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe\nthat the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n74\n",

The\nholders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, and as a consequence, minority\nstockholders are not able to elect directors on the basis of their votes alone.

In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then\noutstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other\nsecurities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nStockholders have no cumulative voting rights.\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly\ncalled annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing and that the stockholders may amend our\nbylaws or adopt new bylaws only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting securities in addition to any vote of the holders of\nany class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or by our certificate of incorporation.\nA special meeting of the stockholders may be called by:\n\u2022\nour Chairman, if any;\n\u2022\nour Chief Executive Officer;\n",

Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers,\nthese provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management.\nThese and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. These provisions\nare intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies of our board of\ndirectors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control. These provisions are\ndesigned to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that\nmay be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares\nand, as a consequence, such provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored\ntakeover attempts.

This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the \u201cDate of Grant\u201d).\nCapitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.\n1.\nGrant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted\nStock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant,\nthe Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the \u201cAccount\u201d) the number of Restricted Stock\nUnits subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with\nrespect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.\n2.\nVesting.\n(a)\nSubject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in\nthe Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.\n(b)\nVesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case\nvesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan).\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your\ndeath, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i)\nsuch acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of\nyour estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if\napplicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under\napplicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of\nsuch acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\n(c)\nOn the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that\nwere not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the\nPlan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such\nRestricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a period prior to\na vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the\nRestricted Stock Units on such date.\n(d)\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Grant Notice or this Agreement, and subject to applicable law, (i) in the event your regular\nlevel of time commitment in the performance of your services for the Company or any Affiliate is reduced after the Date of Grant, a\ncorresponding reduction shall be made (rounded down to the nearest whole share) in the number of shares of Common Stock subject to any\nportion of your Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment, and (ii) in the event you go\non an approved personal leave of absence pursuant to the Company\u2019s Personal Leave of Absence Policy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\nEffective Date: January 23, 2025\n",

In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service\nRecipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related\nItems by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii)\ncausing you to tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or\nrequiring you to enter into a \u201csame day sale\u201d commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a\n\u201cFINRA Dealer\u201d) (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the\nshares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer\nirrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or\nthe Service Recipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of\nCommon Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the\namount of such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the\nAward as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however, that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of\nshares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not\nfeasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which\ncase, any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other\nmethod of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the Plan.\n(c)\nThe Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding\nrates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld\namount in cash from the Company or the Service Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may\nseek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the\napplicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country,\nincluding your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority\u2019s administrative practices, not to exceed\nthe highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-\nRelated Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the\nfull number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\nEffective Date: January 23, 2025\n",

From and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, no additional rights to purchase shares of Common Stock will be\ngranted under the 1998 Plan. All rights to purchase shares granted on or after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date will be\ngranted under this Plan. Any rights to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the 1998 Plan will remain subject to the terms of the\n1998 Plan and any offering document or other agreements or governing documents describing the terms and conditions of offerings made\npursuant to the 1998 Plan.\n(i)\nAny shares of Common Stock that would otherwise remain available for future offerings under the 1998 Plan as of 12:01 a.m.\nPacific Standard Time on the Effective Date (the \u201c1998 Plan's Available Reserve\u201d) will cease to be available under the 1998 Plan at such time.\nInstead, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the 1998 Plan's Available Reserve will be added to the Share Reserve (as further\ndescribed in Section 3(a) below) and be then immediately available for grants hereunder, up to the maximum number set forth in Section 3(a)\nbelow.\n(ii)\nIn addition, from and after 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date, with respect to the aggregate number of\nshares subject, at such time, to outstanding grants under the 1998 Plan that would, but for the operation of this sentence, subsequently return to\nthe share reserve of the 1998 Plan (such shares, the \u201cReturning Shares\u201d), such shares of Common Stock will not return to the share reserve of\nthe 1998 Plan, and instead that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Returning Shares will immediately be added to the Share\nReserve as and when such a share becomes a Returning Share, up to a maximum number set forth in Section 3(a) below.\n(b) The Plan provides a means by which Eligible Employees of the Company and certain Designated Companies may be given an\nopportunity to purchase shares of Common Stock. The Plan permits the Company to grant a series of Purchase Rights to Eligible Employees.\n(c) The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of such Employees, to secure and retain the services of new\nEmployees and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and its Related Corporations.\n(d) This Plan includes two components: a 423 Component and a Non-423 Component. It is the intention of the Company to have the 423\nComponent qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The provisions of the 423 Component, accordingly, will be construed in a manner that\nis consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of Purchase Rights under the Non-423\nComponent that does not meet the requirements of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan because of deviations necessary or advisable to permit\nor\n9.\n",

Except as otherwise provided herein or\ndetermined by the Board, the Non-423 Component will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component. In addition,\nunder the 423 Component of the Plan, the Company may make separate Offerings which vary in terms (although not inconsistent with the\nprovisions in the Plan and not inconsistent with the requirements of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan) and the Company will designate which\nDesignated Company is participating in each separate Offering.\n(e) If a Participant transfers employment from the Company or any Designated 423 Corporation participating in the 423 Component to a\nDesignated Non-423 Corporation participating in the Non-423 Component, he or she will immediately cease to participate in the 423 Component;\nhowever, any Contributions made for the Purchase Period in which such transfer occurs will be transferred to the Non-423 Component, and such\nParticipant will immediately join the then current Offering under the Non-423 Component upon the same terms and conditions in effect for his or\nher participation in the Plan, except for such modifications as may be required by applicable law.

For purposes of this Section 5(c), the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code will apply\nin determining the stock ownership of any Employee, and stock which such Employee may purchase under all outstanding Purchase Rights and\noptions will be treated as stock owned by such Employee.\n(d) As specified by Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, an Eligible Employee may be granted Purchase Rights only if such Purchase Rights,\ntogether with any other rights granted under all Employee Stock Purchase Plans of the Company and any Related Corporations, do not permit\nsuch Eligible Employee's rights to purchase stock of the Company or any Related Corporation to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of Fair\nMarket Value of such stock (determined at the time such rights are granted, and which, with respect to the Plan, will be determined as of their\nrespective Offering Dates) for each calendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time.\n(e) Officers of the Company and any Designated Company, if they are otherwise Eligible Employees, will be eligible to participate in\nOfferings under the Plan.

For clarity, such percentage or maximum dollar amount of such Employee's eligible earnings may be\napplied on the basis of each or any pay-period, Purchase Period or other period during the Offering (including the entire period of the Offering),\nas designated by the Board.\n(b) The Board will establish one or more Purchase Dates during an Offering on which Purchase Rights granted for that Offering will be\nexercised and shares of Common Stock will be purchased in accordance with such Offering.\n(c) In connection with each Offering made under the Plan, the Board may specify (i) a maximum number of shares of Common Stock that\nmay be purchased by any Participant on any Purchase Date during such Offering, (ii) a maximum aggregate number of shares of Common\nStock that may be purchased by all Participants pursuant to such Offering, and/or (iii) a maximum aggregate number of shares of Common\nStock that may be purchased by all Participants on any Purchase Date under the Offering.

If permitted in the Offering, a Participant may reduce (including to\nzero) or increase his or her Contributions. If required under applicable law or if specifically provided in the Offering, in addition to or instead of\nmaking Contributions by payroll deductions, a Participant may make Contributions through the payment by cash or check or wire transfer prior to\na Purchase Date, in the manner directed by the Company.\n(b)\nDuring an Offering, a Participant may cease making Contributions and withdraw from the Offering by delivering to the Company a\nwithdrawal form provided by the Company. The Company may impose a deadline before a Purchase Date for withdrawing. Upon such\nwithdrawal, such Participant's Purchase Right in that Offering will immediately terminate and the Company will distribute to such Participant all of\nhis or her accumulated but unused Contributions. A Participant's withdrawal from that Offering will have no effect upon his or her eligibility to\nparticipate in any other Offerings under the Plan, but the Participant will be required to deliver a new enrollment form to participate in future\nOfferings.\n(c)\nUnless otherwise required by applicable law, Purchase Rights granted pursuant to any Offering under the Plan will terminate\nimmediately if the Participant either (i) is no longer an Employee for any reason or for no reason or (ii) is otherwise no longer eligible to\nparticipate.

No fractional shares will be issued unless specifically provided for in the Offering.\n(b) If any amount of accumulated Contributions remains in a Participant's account after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the\nfinal Purchase Date of an Offering and such remaining amount is less than the amount required to purchase one share of Common Stock, then\nsuch remaining amount will be held in such Participant's account for the purchase of shares of Common Stock under the next Offering under the\nPlan, unless such Participant withdraws from or is not eligible to participate in such Offering, in which case such amount will be distributed to\nsuch Participant after the final Purchase Date, without interest (unless otherwise required by applicable law).

If you use a third party to trade on your behalf, you are responsible for\nensuring they adhere to this Policy in any activity they perform for you.\nAny trading activity by persons in your household, family members, or anyone subject to your influence may create an appearance of misconduct, exposing you\nand NVIDIA to significant legal risk.\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\n\u201cMNPI\u201d is material, non-public information. Information is material if it would influence a reasonable investor to trade or would significantly alter the total mix of\npublicly available information. Information is non-public if it has not yet been broadly released to the public by way of a press release, conference call, public\nfiling, or similar means of public dissemination.\nWhile most NVIDIA employees work with company confidential information, only a small subset of non-public information rises to the level of MNPI. Examples of\nmaterial information could include: financial results; significant mergers or acquisitions; major contracts; significant information regarding NVIDIA\u2019s products and\nservices; significant information about competition, customers, or market demand; major cybersecurity breaches, data protection or privacy incidents; key\npersonnel changes; significant litigation; or material regulatory activity.\nBLANKET PROHIBITIONS\nFederal and state insider trading laws prohibit transacting in securities of any company when in possession of MNPI relevant to that company.\nFederal and state laws also prohibit \u201ctipping\u201d or disclosing MNPI to third parties who then transact on that information\u2014the tipper can be legally liable even if\nthey do not benefit financially from any transaction.\nThe following additional activities also are restricted at all times, regardless of whether you have MNPI or whether NVIDIA\u2019s trading window (if applicable to you)\nis open:\n\u2022\nTrading in NVIDIA Derivatives. You may not trade in derivatives of NVIDIA securities, including call and put options.\n\u2022\nHedging or Shorting NVIDIA.

You will be notified by Legal if you become subject to a special trading restriction. If so, you may not trade in NVIDIA securities until you\nare notified that the special restriction has ended.\nEXCEPTIONS\nThe prohibited activities above do not apply to:\n\u2022\n10b5-1 Trades.
