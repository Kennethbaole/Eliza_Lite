The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of\naccidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company\u2019s cloud services store and keep customers\u2019 content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as\nbooks, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade , a game service; Apple Fitness+ , a personalized fitness\nservice; Apple Music , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ , a news and magazine service; and\nApple TV , which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless payment service.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not\nincluded in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services,\neach one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each\ngeographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The\nCompany sells its services in the same markets through its various service platforms. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such\nas third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers, for the sale of its products and certain of its services. During 2025, the Company\u2019s net sales through\nits direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 40% and 60%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition, downward pressure on\ngross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the\nCompany competes are further defined by frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low\ncost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2\n",

        "text": "The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party\nsoftware and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to effectively protect and\nenforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources,\nas well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as\ncompetitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects\ncompetition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer\nintegrated solutions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in\nthe global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the availability of\nthe Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents; however, the Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be\nsuccessful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nIn addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development\n(\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, software and services. This includes\npatents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the\nCompany believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part\non such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its hardware, software and service\nresearch, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated\na large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the\nCompany\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products\nand services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 3\n",

        "text": "In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be\nlicensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and\nservices. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such\nlicenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to\ncreate a culture of collaboration, one where people with a broad range of backgrounds and perspectives can come together to innovate and do the best work of\ntheir lives. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. As of\nSeptember\u00a027, 2025, the Company had approximately 166,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and offers discretionary cash and equity awards to enable employees to share in\nthe Company\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and\nsupport to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world,\nincluding health, wellness and time away.\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on\nleadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical\nand personal development.\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work\nenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusion.\nThe Company is committed to the safety and security of its team members everywhere it operates. The Company supports employees with general safety,\nsecurity and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to\nSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d).

The Company may not be able to accurately predict, control or mitigate these risks. Statements in this section are based on the Company\u2019s beliefs\nand opinions regarding matters that could materially adversely affect the Company in the future and are not representations as to whether such matters have or\nhave not occurred previously. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exhaustive and should not be considered a complete statement of all potential\nrisks or uncertainties that the Company faces or may face in the future.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency\nfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In\naddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,\ndeclines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nUncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers,\nlogistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to\nobtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties\nand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial\ninstruments.

A significant majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing\npartners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the\nU.S. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the\nCompany derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the\navailability of the Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the\nCompany to change suppliers, restructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing the Company\u2019s business and\nsupply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s business\nand results of operations. Trade and other international disputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts\nand reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from such measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an\nescalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on\nimports to the U.S. (\u201cU.S. Tariffs\u201d), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d),\namong others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures.\nVarious modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based\ntariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,\nas amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream\nproducts that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental\nU.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more\nsevere and restrictive.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are\nin locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme\nweather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to\nthe risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware\nand other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the\nCompany\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and negatively\nimpact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the\nsupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\n",

        "text": "Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose\nsignificant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption\naffecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of\nlosses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition,\ndownward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These\nmarkets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of\ntechnological advancements.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve\nexpected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual property rights. Regulatory\nrequirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or modify its products and services for, certain countries and\nlimit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its intellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its\ninnovations with competitors. Any of these outcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources,\nas well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s\nproduct features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors\nimitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\nCompany\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\nstructures to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal\ncomputer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or\ncontracted overall.\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially adversely\naffected.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\n",

        "text": "Business Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products\nand services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and\nservices, navigate global regulatory requirements and barriers to market access, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products\nand services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled personnel to execute on its strategic initiatives, and the timely and successful development and market acceptance of new products, services and\ntechnologies. Success also relies on the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the effective\nintegration of third-party services and technologies into the Company\u2019s products and services, the availability, delivery and performance of application software\nor other third-party support for the Company\u2019s products and services, the effective management of manufacturing and other purchase commitments and the\nmanagement of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\nanticipated demand. Additionally, quality issues or other defects or deficiencies can adversely affect the success of new product and service introductions and\nmarket acceptance. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit\nmargins. The Company may not be able to successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, which can materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nA significant majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. The Company relies on single-source partners in the\nU.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s hardware products. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower\noperating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time had, and may in\nthe future have, an adverse effect on the cost, quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to\nrespond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company\ngenerally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product\ndefect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct\noccur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nChanges or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure\nto additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the global\nsemiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company may\nnot be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities\nfrom its suppliers in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be\nsubject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to\nmeet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at\nall. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results\nof operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 8\n",

Sophisticated operating\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of\nhardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects\ncould make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\nCompany\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from\ntime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may\nnot meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety\nrisks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. The Company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and\nservices. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user\u2019s device. In addition, the Company can\nbe exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets,\nand significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the\nCompany\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for\nproducts and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories if cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company reviews other assets, including\ncapital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the\nassets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets are currently recoverable,\nthe Company may incur write-downs, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which\nthe Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize purchase commitments. The Company accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders\nof excess products and components.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or\nat all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. In addition, because of technological\nchanges in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive intellectual property coverage and the rapid\nrate of new intellectual property rights generation, the Company\u2019s products and services may be alleged to infringe existing intellectual property rights of others.\nThis risk may be exacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can involve, among\nother things, the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training as well as the potential reproduction of copyrighted materials in their outputs. From time\nto time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain intellectual property rights of third parties. The Company is not always able to obtain all\nnecessary licenses to third-party intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual\nproperty, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or\npreclude the Company from selling certain products or services and expose the Company to significant licensing costs, all of which can materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9\n",

        "text": "The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices. Third-party developers may discontinue the development and maintenance of software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-\nparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s\nproducts, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company believes that third-party developer support depends on the perceived benefits of creating software and services for the Company\u2019s products\ncompared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and\nXbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that\nmay be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets can make developers less inclined to develop\nor upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with\nlarger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can\nsuffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products\nand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of\nchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in\ndissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable\nterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party\ncontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can\nbe for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some\nthird-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\nwith acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled\nemployees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel,\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. Periods of intense competition\nfor talent in particular fields can lead to increased costs as the Company seeks to offer competitive compensation to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.\nIn addition to competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and the Company must navigate changes effectively in order to achieve its\nstrategic initiatives. Laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws and export controls, among others, can materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled, global workforce. If the Company does not effectively manage changing workforce dynamics and\nregulatory requirements, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, operational flexibility, strategy and costs, all of which can materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 10\n",

The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption\nand other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access\nto or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are\nalso exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks target the\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information and may disrupt normal business operations. Attacks can impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract\nand retain customers for its products and services, affect its stock price, damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government\ninvestigations, potentially resulting in penalties, fines or judgments.

To help protect customers and the Company,\nthe Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze\naccounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the\nCompany\u2019s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient\nto cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not\noriginally contemplated, and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic,\npolitical, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Some transactions, including investments and acquisitions, are exposed to additional risks, including\nfailing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, a counterparty\u2019s failure to perform or deliver as anticipated, or the imposition of onerous\nconditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits\nof a transaction. New business strategies and ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company\u2019s business strategies and investments\nmay not be successful, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\ngovernment investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet\nbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, the Company enters into agreements that include indemnification provisions that can\nsubject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time\nand may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its standards-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the\nfuture, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology, data and other intellectual property asset\u2013holding companies\nfrequently assert their intellectual property rights and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of\nintellectual property rights. These risks, and the risks of novel claims being attempted, may be exacerbated as new and emerging technologies, including\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence, are further integrated into the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief\nand substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve such challenges. However, such agreements may not always be available on acceptable terms, and litigation may still arise. Such agreements can\nalso significantly reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses, materially adversely affecting the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Additionally, such agreements may require the Company to change its business\npractices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 12\n",

        "text": "The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price for that\nreporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or\nprofits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company. Adverse resolution of legal matters has from time to time required, and can in the\nfuture require, the Company to change its business practices. It can also limit the Company\u2019s ability to enjoin others from using, or to derive value from, its\nintellectual property rights, and to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and\ndata localization; online safety; age verification; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product\nliability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption;\nimport, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national\nsecurity; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement\npriorities can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to\ncustomers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and\nrequiring changes to the Company\u2019s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can\nalso create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. If the Company is found to have violated such laws and regulations,\nit could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nRisks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities increase as the Company\u2019s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating\nto the export and import of its products. The Company\u2019s programs, policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation.\nAs a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nVaried stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and\nother adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nVarious stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing expectations about a wide range of social\nand other issues related to the Company\u2019s business. The Company makes statements about its values, including the environmental and societal impact of its\nbusiness, through various reports, information provided on the Company\u2019s website, and in press statements and other communications. The Company also\npursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or\ndata that is outside the Company\u2019s control, and the Company may not be able to fully achieve all of its goals and initiatives. Efforts by the Company to advance\nits business and values, or achieve its goals and further its initiatives, or to align with stakeholders\u2019 expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times\nconflicting federal, state and international laws, executive orders, regulations and standards, or any failure or perceived failure to do so, can result in adverse\nreactions by consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company, and can materially\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 13\n",

        "text": "The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its business, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented\nchanges to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing\nmechanisms and is currently subject to a court order preventing it from imposing any commission or fee on certain purchases that consumers make.\nGlobally, several jurisdictions have adopted, or may in the future adopt, competition-related laws and regulations imposing wide-ranging obligations on\ntechnology companies and significant limitations on businesses, including the Company. For example, the Company has implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS,\nthe App Store and Safari  in the EU as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (\u201cDMA\u201d), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for\niOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u2019s operating\nsystems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan\nin response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company\u2019s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA\u2019s obligations, it has\nbeen challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance.\nWhile the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will\nremain. Changes to the Company\u2019s business in response to the DMA or other laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and\nclaims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted\nmonopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the\nsubject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the\nCompany, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and\nlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners\nand materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company earns revenue\nfrom licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and\ncertain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated\nU.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, on September 2, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\u201cD.C. District Court\u201d) ordered certain\nremedies. The court\u2019s order is subject to further proceedings before the D.C. District Court, which may result in changes to the interpretation or application of the\nremedies ordered by the court, as well as new or changed remedies being ordered. The court\u2019s order is also subject to appeal by both the U.S. Department of\nJustice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and Google. A reversal of the order on appeal could result in imposition of certain remedies initially proposed by the DOJ, such as those\nprohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution. If implemented, these remedies could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the\noutcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new\nlaws and regulations or in connection with legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security. Such\nchanges in business practices can also otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the\nCompany\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 14\n",

        "text": "The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding the collection, use,\nprotection and transfer of personal data.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of\nvarious types of personal data. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal data among the\nCompany and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional\nrestrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business\npractices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal data through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements\nand other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure or perceived failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries, proceedings and penalties from governmental entities or others. Such a\nfailure or perceived failure could also result in reputational impacts, ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The risks of inadvertent disclosure of\npersonal data can increase with the introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, further exacerbating such risks.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of personal data, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to the collection and processing of data associated with minors, as well as information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as\nhealth, biometric, financial and payment card data. Health, biometric, financial and payment card data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach\nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the\nCompany fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, can be liable for\nassociated investigatory expenses, and can incur significant fees or fines.\nThe Company is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations regarding online safety, including enhanced protections for minors and mandatory age\nverification requirements. These laws and regulations can increase regulatory risks by requiring complex compliance measures and significant modifications to\nthe Company\u2019s products, services and operations, and may lead to operational disruptions, heightened privacy and data security risks, increased costs and\npotential liability and fines, all of which can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.\nThe Company\u2019s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels and can change over time. The\nCompany\u2019s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to\neffectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage\nproduct quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent\nthat regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other\nmacroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in\nresponse; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its\nnet sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact net sales and gross margins.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses\nworldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the\npast been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\n",

        "text": "Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future\nfluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition\nand stock price.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers. The Company also sells its\nproducts and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of\nthe Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk\non its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of\ncomponents by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company\nhas made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a027, 2025, the Company\u2019s\nvendor non-trade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to monitor and limit\nexposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition\nand stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\nare organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be\nsubject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is inherently uncertain. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\ndetermination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\n",

The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed\nthrough the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users.

The Company has appealed the Commission\u2019s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the\nCommission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there\nhas been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may\nalso seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA\nand has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the DOJ and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New\nJersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation\nof U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been\nfiled in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (\u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d) against the Company alleging violations\nof federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court\nfound that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the \u201c2021 Injunction\u201d)\nenjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing\nmechanisms other than the Company\u2019s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS App Stores.\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California\nDistrict Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases\nthat consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or\notherwise interfering with a consumer\u2019s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company\u2019s motion to narrow or vacate\nthe 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt\nproceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court\u2019s most\nrecent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (\u201cNinth Circuit Court\u201d). Although the Company\u2019s request to stay the decision pending appeal was\ndenied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company\u2019s appeal on an expedited basis, with oral arguments heard in October 2025.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected.\nItem 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 18\n",

In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other\nretaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include\nadditional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade\nExpansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative\nproducts, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company\u2019s products or their\ncomponents can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\u2019s\nsupply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will\ndepend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries\nimplement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes\ncan have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer\nsentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\n2025\nChange\n2024\nChange\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n178,353\u00a0\n7\u00a0%\n$\n167,045\u00a0\n3\u00a0%\n$\n162,560\u00a0\nEurope\n111,032\u00a0\n10\u00a0%\n101,328\u00a0\n7\u00a0%\n94,294\u00a0\nGreater China\n64,377\u00a0\n(4)%\n66,952\u00a0\n(8)%\n72,559\u00a0\nJapan\n28,703\u00a0\n15\u00a0%\n25,052\u00a0\n3\u00a0%\n24,257\u00a0\nRest of Asia Pacific\n33,696\u00a0\n10\u00a0%\n30,658\u00a0\n4\u00a0%\n29,615\u00a0\nTotal net sales\n$\n416,161\u00a0\n6\u00a0%\n$\n391,035\u00a0\n2\u00a0%\n$\n383,285\u00a0\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

ASU 2024-03 will require the Company to disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible\nasset amortization, as applicable, included in certain expense captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as qualitatively describe remaining\namounts included in those captions. ASU 2024-03 will also require the Company to disclose both the amount and the Company\u2019s definition of selling expenses.\nThe Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition method.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-09\u201d), which will require\nthe Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a\nquantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with\nfurther disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective\ntransition method.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that\naffect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final\noutcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have\na material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 26\n",

        "text": "Legal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\nsignificant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nItem 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\nhowever, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\ninterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect\nagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\nand term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that\nwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a027, 2025 and September\u00a028, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2025\n2024\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$\n2,416\u00a0\n$\n2,755\u00a0\nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$\n129\u00a0\n$\n139\u00a0\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $590 million and $538 million as of September\u00a0 27, 2025 and September\u00a0 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s\nunderlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 27\n",

        "text": "Derivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate and retail facilities.\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is\ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are\ntransferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales,\ncontrol transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control\nor commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material\nperformance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.\nThe second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri  and Maps. The\nCompany allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\nobservable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the\ndelivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.\nRevenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be\nprovided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\nproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\n",

As of September\u00a027, 2025, 13% of the Company\u2019s non-current mortgage-\nand asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 14% between 5 and 10 years, and 73% greater than 10 years.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt\nsecurities as either current or non-current based on each instrument\u2019s underlying maturity.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on\nintended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in\nvalue of the hedged item.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of\namounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss).\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being\nhedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these\ninstruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use\nforwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\u00a027,\n2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency\ntransactions is 17 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to\ncalculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January\n2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.\nThe Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15,\n2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European\nCourt of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the\nCommission\u2019s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2\u00a0billion, net,\nwhich represented $15.8\u00a0billion payable to Ireland via release of amounts held in escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8\u00a0billion and a decrease\nin unrecognized tax benefits of $823\u00a0million.\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\nThe provision for income taxes for 2025, 2024 and 2023, consisted of the following (in millions):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$\n11,487\u00a0\n$\n5,571\u00a0\n$\n9,445\u00a0\nDeferred\n(1,804)\n(3,080)\n(3,644)\nTotal\n9,683\u00a0\n2,491\u00a0\n5,801\u00a0\nState:\nCurrent\n1,680\u00a0\n1,726\u00a0\n1,570\u00a0\nDeferred\n(139)\n(298)\n(49)\nTotal\n1,541\u00a0\n1,428\u00a0\n1,521\u00a0\nForeign:\nCurrent\n8,891\u00a0\n25,483\u00a0\n8,750\u00a0\nDeferred\n604\u00a0\n347\u00a0\n669\u00a0\nTotal\n9,495\u00a0\n25,830\u00a0\n9,419\u00a0\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n20,719\u00a0\n$\n29,749\u00a0\n$\n16,741\u00a0\nForeign pretax earnings were $82.0 billion, $77.3 billion and $72.9 billion in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 40\n",

Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company\u2019s operating leases were $2.1 billion for 2025 and $2.0 billion for both\n2024 and 2023. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company\u2019s leases were $16.1 billion, $13.8 billion and $13.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nThe Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $2.1 billion in 2025 and $1.9 billion in both 2024 and 2023.

In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the availability of\nthe Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents; however, the Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be\nsuccessful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nIn addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 46\n",

The Company\u2019s CEO is its CODM.\nThe Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South\nAmerica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nRest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the\nreportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the\nCompany\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nThe CODM uses segment net sales and operating income information to make certain decisions, such as product and service pricing, and to decide how to\nallocate resources related to sales activities and marketing investments. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers\nand sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties,\nrelated cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of September\u00a027, 2025 and September\u00a028, 2024, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nSeptember\u00a027, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at September\u00a027, 2025 and September\u00a028, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended September\u00a027, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September\u00a027, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October\u00a031, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\u00a0 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\u00a0 involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September\u00a027, 2025, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was\n$23.2 billion, of which $10.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. In accounting for\nsome of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of\nGAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and\nthe measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based\non interpretations of tax laws.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 49\n",

Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober\u00a031, 2025\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 51\n",

The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\u00a0\n(i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s\nassets;\n(ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management\nand directors; and\n(iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember\u00a027, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2025, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 52\n",
